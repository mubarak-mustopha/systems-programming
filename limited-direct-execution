Virtualization of CPU: Illusion of inifinitely many CPU's available 
to run multiple jobs at the same time.
How to virtualize the CPU??  Time sharing!!
Challenges:
	1. Performance
	2. Control
Run programs directly on CPU (Performance):
	1. How does OS ensure it doesn't perform illegal
	   actions?
	2. How does OS stop a process to give CPU to another??
	   Thereby achieving virtualization.
Restricted operations (Control):
	* How do programs perform restricted operations (they need to
	  e.g I/O)
	  without taking control over the system?

Hardware support for restricted operations
	1. Dual mode of operation (user and kernel mode)
	2. Instructions to trap into kernel from user mode
	   and vice versae (system calls)
	3. Instructions to inform hardware where trap table is
	   located in kernel memory
	   
Sys calls allow kernel to carefully expose certain key pieces of
functionalities to user programs e.g
	* accessing file system
	* creating/destroying processes
	* communicating with other processes
	* allocating more memory
	
A user program makes sys call by executing a `trap` instruction
which a. jumps into kernel
      b. raises privilege level to kernel mode.
Kernel executes return-from-trap instruction and the reverse of the
above will occur
